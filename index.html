        <h3>Hi! This is Mr.Karuna</h3>
        <p class="note">
            I am thrilled that you will be in my class this academic year 2022-2023. We are going to learn so many new and exciting things together. This my 27th year of teaching in school. It is important to treat each other with respect, kindness, and compassion during Math and Digital Literacy lessons.
